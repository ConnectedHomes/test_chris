## Github App ukh-aws-ci-web-webhook

As many different repos need to consume the webhook provided by this Stack, the corresponding configuration has been moved away from each repo's setting and into its [own github App](https://github.com/organizations/ConnectedHomes/settings/apps/ukh-aws-ci-web-webhook).
* If needed (probably not), change the **production** webhook URL in this github App
* Add this app to your repo if you want to use the CI provided by this stack.

## Shared Stack

Refer to [shared stack wiki](https://github.com/ConnectedHomes/shared-devops-ci-step-functions/blob/main/README.md).

## Stages

### Stages overview

* Each stage deploys its own S3 buckets, cloudformation stacks, lambdas, and [API gateways](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/main/apis?region=eu-west-1), all of them having your stage value in their names.
* When creating a new stage, you will create a new webhook. Add the [corresponding URL](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/home?region=eu-west-1#/apis/386cbuqh62/stages/prod/resources/~1apiResource/methods/POST) to your repo webhook settings **only once, and then you shouldn't need to change anything on the repo** (ask a github admin for that, Lionel or Shilpa).
* The stage logic allows to consume several stages for the same repo without disturbing the workflow of the developers who keep consuming normally the "prod" stage on their branches.
* The logic is the following:
  *  branch names containing the string "stage-{StageName}" will trigger the flow of the corresponding stage stack
  *  other branches will be ignored for this stage, except for the "prod" stage that will work with all branches except those with format "stage-XX".


### Creating a new Stage

Change:

* the [STAGE_NAME environment variable](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codebuild/projects/ukh-aws-ci-web/edit/environment?region=eu-west-1) to the name of your stack (typically, use your name: biplav, lionel or shilpa)
* start build
* Add the webhook to the repo(s) you want to test as per previous section.

### Updating an existing Stage

* the [buildspec path](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codebuild/projects/ukh-aws-ci-web/edit/buildspec?region=eu-west-1) to digital_Web_CI_Stack/buildspec_update.yml
* the [STAGE_NAME environment variable](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codebuild/projects/ukh-aws-ci-web/edit/environment?region=eu-west-1) to the name of your stack (typically, use your name: biplav, lionel or shilpa)
* start build
